## General Information
Given the name of one to two League of Legends pro players and the name
of a tournament, the program web scrapes the League of Legends Gampedia
wiki to return comparative stats between the two players (or just solo
stats if given only one name).

This was made to help with more quickly comparing the performance of
two players in a specific tournament.
